    "## Inverse Square Law\n",
    "When light leaves the surface of an astronomical object, like a star's photosphere, the resulting light spreads out radially in all directions at the speed of light. All the energy emitted at that same instant can be thought of as being spread out over surface of a sphere. As this imaginary sphere gets bigger, the light gets more spread out. This is why distance matters when looking at a light source. Note the equation for the surface area of a sphere:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "A=4\\pi{R^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "The closer you are, the more concentrated the light is because the sphere over which it is spread is smaller (smaller radius, R). The farther you get from the source, the bigger the sphere must be when it reaches you (larger radius, R) and consequently, the light is spread out more and so the source seems dimmer.\n",

    "\n",
    "The physical properties of electromagnetic radiation eminating from a star or other astronomical object is best described using flux which is related to power which is related to energy. Another common way to describe light leaving an astronomical object is through the concept of luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzman relation connections the energy density of a star (how much energy leaves 1 square meter of the star's surfce) and the star's temperature.\n",

    "For historical and convenience reasons, astronomers use a system called magnitude dating back to Hipparcos which uses the star Vega as a reference star. There are many peculiarlities with magnitude. For example a negative magnitude represents a brighter object than does a positive magnitude. Another useful point is that just using light from an image, astronomers can quickly measure the magnitude as seen from earth, the apparent magnitude. That leaves some work to do to get turn the physical brightness or luminosity of the object into the absolute magnitude. The magnitude scale is clunky but still in use - for now."
